### Team:
- Sarah Kitten

### Worked with team to do:
- Dot product: Gargoyles now turn to face the player.
- Linear interpolation: Ghosts spin towards the player when the player gets close

### Worked individually to do:
- Particle effect: smokey ghosts (I'm sure you've never seen that one before)
- Each member did entire tutorial individually
